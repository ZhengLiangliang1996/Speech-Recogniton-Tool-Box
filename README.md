# Speech Recognition Tool Box

A  end-to-end speech recognition tool box implemented in Tensorflow

## Getting Started

This is a tensorflow implementation tool box for automatic speech recognition, support training with CPU/GPU. The model includes


### Prerequisites

First you need to install feature extraction packages for MFCC or fBank. 

Install python speech features from pypi

```
pip install python_speech_features
```

or install it from repository

```
git clone https://github.com/jameslyons/python_speech_features
python setup.py develop
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Implementation Details and NN Architecture
1. Bi-RNN
2. Bi-LSTM
3. CNN
4. GAN

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
